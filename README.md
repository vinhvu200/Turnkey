# Turnkey
For my senior experience project, we (a group a business students and computer science students) were tasked with creating a prototype android mobile application for Turnkey Strategic Relations. Although I cannot disclose the source code, I can show screenshots of the application and it's functionalities.

# Goal
The goal of this application is for someone higher up in the company (such as a CEO) to be able to check on his or her company at any point in time to see progression of tasks. This application will track all professional and personal objectives of employees in order to provide consistent feedback for continuous improvement.

# Notes
![Image 0](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/0.png "Image 0")

Here is the hierarchy of goals to be referenced as you read. 
- Group Goals are comprised of Individual Goals
- Individual Goals are comprised of Milestones
- Milestones are comprised of competencies

The metric used in this application are all arbitrary percentages but portrays how this application should function. It is up to the company to come up with the best way to evaluate these goals. Also... Apologies in advance about photo quality and sizing (it proved a bit difficult to size things here)

# Dashboard
![Image 1](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/1.png "Image 1")

This dashboard screen allows the CEO to swipe through and pick one of the four actions he would like to take:
- Locations: shows the different branches of the company
- Individual Goals: shows all his individual goals and their progression
- Personal Goals: shows all his personal goals and their progression
- Groups: shows all his group goals and their details

# Locations
![Image 2](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/2.png "Image 2")

Clicking on location will bring you to a world map
- Each pin represent another branch of the company
- Clicking onto any of the pins will show a percentage to show how well they are doing 

# Group Goals
![Image 3/4](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/3:4.png "Image 3/4")

Clicking onto the percentage of a pin will zoom down into the location and give two additional options: View Employees, and View Goals. We will be looking at "View Goals" first.
- Group Goals will be the first set of goals to see
- There is a goal objective, along with the supervisor in charge
- Again, there is a percentage to show how well it is doing

# Group Goal Details
![Image 5](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/5.png "Image 5")

Clicking onto one of these group goals will show its details.
- Basic information will be left at top (objective, supervisor, start/end time)
- There will be a list of individual goals that makes up this group goal
- Each individual goal is structured the same (objective, percentage, and assigned employee)

# Individual Goal Detail
![Image 6](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/6.png "Image 6")

Clicking onto an individual goal will show its details
- List of milestones that make up the individual goal
- A check to represent whether the goal has been completed
- Under each milestone, there are competencies related to it

# Provide Feedback
![Image 7](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/7.png "Image 7")

Clicking onto the star of one of the milestones will bring the user here 
- Here, the user may leave feedback pertaining to the milestone
- Along with feedback, they are able to rate one of the competencies

# Feedback List
![Image 8](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/8.png "Image 8")

After hitting submit, the user may see all the other feedback that has been given to that specific milestone.

# View Employees
![Image 9](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/9.png "Image 9")

Backtracking to the earlier view, we will now go into the "View Employees" option. It is exactly what you would expect, a list of employees working within that branch.

# Performance Review
![Image 10](https://github.com/vinhvu200/Turnkey/raw/master/images/10.png "Image 10")

After clicking onto one of the employees, this page is brought up.
- Lists all the competencies and their ratings
- All ratings are separated into three: Executive, Manager, and Aggregate
- These ratings will identify an employee's strength and weakness
in order to see how the employee is doing tasks relating to that competency.
